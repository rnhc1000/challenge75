/**
 * Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board.
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 * In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile.
 * Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally
 * adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has
 * both squares occupied by a tile.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 1000
 * first 10 numbers output:
 * [1,2,5,11,24,53,117,258,569,1255]
 * observe the pattern 11=5x2+1, 24=11x2+2, 53=24x2+5......
