/*
 * In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n.
 * There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 * If the town judge exists, then:
 * The town judge trusts nobody.
 * Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 * There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 * You are given an array trust where trust = [[a,i], [b,i]] representing
 * that the person labeled [a][i] trusts the person labeled [b][i].
 * If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.
 * Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or
 * return -1 otherwise.
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} trust
 * @return {number}
 * trust = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3]];
