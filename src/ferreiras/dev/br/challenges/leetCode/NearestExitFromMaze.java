/**
 * You are given an m x n matrix maze (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as '.')
 * and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the entrance of the maze, where
 * entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol] denotes the row and column of the cell you are
 * initially standing at.
 * In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a
 * cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the
 * nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the
 * border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.
 * Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit,
 * or -1 if no such path exists.
 * Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
 * Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
 * - You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
 * - You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
 * It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
 * Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
