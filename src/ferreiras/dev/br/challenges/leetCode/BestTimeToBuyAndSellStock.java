/**
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on
 * the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions
 * as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
 * Note:
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell
 * the stock before you buy again).
 * The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
 * - Buying at prices[0] = 1
 * - Selling at prices[3] = 8
 * - Buying at prices[4] = 4
 * - Selling at prices[5] = 9
 * The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
 * Output: 6
