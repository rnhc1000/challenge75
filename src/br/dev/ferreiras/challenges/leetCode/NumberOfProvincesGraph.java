 *
 547. Number of Provinces
  There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not.
 If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected
 directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

 A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and
 no other cities outside of the group.

 You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1
 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and
 isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
 Return the total number of provinces.
