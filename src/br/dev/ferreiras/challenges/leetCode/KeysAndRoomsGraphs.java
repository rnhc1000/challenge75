/**
 * There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0.
 * Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without
 * having its key.
 * When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number
 * on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock
 * the other rooms.
 * Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you
 * visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
 * We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
 * We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
 * We then visit room 3.
 * Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 * We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
