/**
 * Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas.
 * The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
 * Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k.
 * Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile.
 * If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more
 * bananas during this hour.
 * Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
 * Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
 * Output: 4
 * Example 2:
 * Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
 * Output: 30
 * Example 3:
 * Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
 * Output: 23
