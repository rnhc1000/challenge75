/*
Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]).
In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains
at position 0, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array.
The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.

Return the integer which will win the game.

It is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation:
Let's see the rounds of the game:
Round |       arr       | winner | win_count
  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1
  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1
  3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1
  4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2
So we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10
Output: 3
Explanation:
3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.


Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 106
arr contains distinct integers.
1 <= k <= 109
