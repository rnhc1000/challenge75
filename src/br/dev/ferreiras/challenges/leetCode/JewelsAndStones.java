/*
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels,
and stones representing the stones you have.
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have.
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.
