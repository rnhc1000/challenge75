/**
 * Given an integer array arr, partition the array into (contiguous)
 * subarrays of length at most k. After partitioning, each subarray
 * has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.
 * Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.
 * Test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3
 * Output: 84
 * Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: arr = [1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], k = 4
 * Output: 83
 * Example 3:
 * Input: arr = [1], k = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Approach
 * Initialize a DP array: Initialize a DP array of length n+1 (n being the
 * length of the input array) with all zeros.
 * This DP array will store the maximum sum achievable up to each index.
 * The reason for having n+1 elements is to conveniently handle the base case
 * where no elements have been considered yet (i.e., dp[0] = 0).
 * Iterating Through the Array: For each element in the array (
 * from the first to the last), determine the maximum sum achievable up to that point.
 * This involves considering all possible partition sizes up to k that could end at
 * the current element.
 * Considering All Partitions Up to Size k: For each element i, look back up to k
 * elements to find the partition that maximizes the sum.
 * This step involves two sub-steps:
 * Finding the maximum value in the current partition (max), which will be used to
 * update all elements in the partition to this value.
 * Calculating the maximum sum for the current partition by adding the product of
 * the maximum value (max) and the partition size (j) to
 * the maximum sum achievable before this partition started (dp[i-j]).
 * Updating the DP Array: Update dp[i] with the maximum sum achievable by including
 * the current element in a partition. This is done by comparing the sum calculated
 * for each possible partition size and choosing the maximum.
 *
 * Result:
 * After filling the DP array, the maximum sum after partitioning the array is found
 * at dp[n], which accounts for the entire array.
