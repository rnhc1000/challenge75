/*
You are given a binary array nums and an integer k.

A k-bit flip is choosing a subarray of length k from nums and simultaneously changing every 0 in the
subarray to 1, and every 1 in the subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array.
If it is not possible, return -1.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Flip nums[0], then flip nums[2].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,0], k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: No matter how we flip subarrays of size 2, we cannot make the array become [1,1,1].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
Flip nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]: nums becomes [1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]
Flip nums[4],nums[5],nums[6]: nums becomes [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
Flip nums[5],nums[6],nums[7]: nums becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= k <= nums.length

Intuition
The goal is to make sure there are no 0s left in the array after performing the minimum number of k-bit flips.
A k-bit flip will flip every bit (0 to 1, or 1 to 0) in a subarray of length k.
To achieve the minimum number of flips, we need to be strategic about where and when to flip the bits.

Approach
Tracking Flips: Use a helper array isFlipped to keep track of flips.
This array will mark whether a flip operation is active at a particular index.
Flipped State: Maintain a flipped state to indicate the number of active flips.
Iterate through the array:
For each position i, check if it needs to be flipped.
This is determined by the parity of flipped and the current bit (nums[i]).
If the bit needs to be flipped:
Ensure that flipping a subarray starting at i and extending to i + k - 1 is within bounds.
Mark this position in isFlipped as starting a flip.
Update the flipped state.
Increment the result counter which counts the number of flips.
If the position i - k was previously flipped, decrement the flipped state.
Complexity
Time Complexity:
 O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.
Each element is processed a constant number of times.
Space Complexity:
O(n), for the additional isFlipped array used to keep track of the flips.
