/*
 * There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 roads such that there is
 * only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree).
 * Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction
 * because they are too narrow.
 * Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a
 * road from city ai to city bi.
 * This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want
 * to travel to this city.
 * Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0.
 * Return the minimum number of edges changed.
 * It's guaranteed that each city can reach city 0 after reorder.
 * Input:
 * n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
 * Output:
 * 3
 * Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can
 * reach the node 0 (capital).
 * Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can
 * reach the node 0 (capital).
 * Example 3:
 * Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
 * Output: 0
