In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another
longer word - let's call this word derivative.
For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces,
replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:

Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
Example 2:

Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"


Constraints:

1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100
dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.
1 <= sentence.length <= 106
sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.
sentence does not have leading or trailing space

Intuition - https://leetcode.com/initishjha
The problem asks us to replace words in a sentence with their shortest root from a given
dictionary. We can leverage a trie data structure to efficiently search for these roots.
A trie is a tree where each node represents a character in a word.
By traversing the trie, we can check if a prefix of the word exists as a root in the dictionary.

Approach
Trie Construction:
Build a trie from the dictionary words.
Each node in the trie will have an array of child nodes (one for each lowercase letter)
and a boolean flag indicating if it's a complete word.
Sentence Processing:
Split the sentence into individual words.
Iterate through each word:
Traverse the trie for that word, checking if any prefix is marked as a root.
If a root is found, replace the word with that root (prioritize the shortest root in case of ambiguity).
If no root is found, keep the original word.
Result Formation:
Build the final sentence by joining the processed words with spaces.
Remove any trailing whitespace using trim().
