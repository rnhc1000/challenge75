You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.

A move consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column
(i.e., changing all 0's to 1's, and all 1's to 0's).

Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum
of these numbers.
Return the highest possible score after making any number of moves (including zero moves).

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
Explanation: 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: 1


Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 20
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

Intuition
By maximizing the number of set bits in the most significant bit positions,
we can achieve maximum possible score.

Approach: Greedy + Toggling
Here's how the approach works:

Initial Score Initialization: We initially assume that all the bits in the most significant position
are set bits, meaning first column contains all 1s, which can be done by multiplying the number of
rows n with the value represented by the most significant bit (1 << (m - 1)).

Column Toggling:
We then iterate over the remaining columns (from the second column to the last column) to determine
whether toggling (flipping) the entire column would increase the score or not.

Value of the Current Column:
We then calculate a value val for each column j represented by that column's bit position (1 << (m - 1 - j)).

Counting Matching Rows:
We then count the number of rows represented by set , where the value in the current column j matches the
value in the first column (0 or 1) by iterating over all rows and comparing grid[i][j] with grid[i][0].

To Toggle or Not:
If the number of rows set is greater than or equal to n/2 (half the number of rows), its beneficial for us
to not toggle (flip) the column. Otherwise, it is better to toggle (flip) the entire column to increase the
score.

Updating the Score:
We then update the res score by adding the maximum value between set * val (if the column is kept unchanged)
and (n - set) * val (if the column is toggled), ensuring that the score is maximized by either keeping the
current column unchanged or toggling it.

Resulting Score:
After iterating through all columns, we return the maximum score res.

This approach works because toggling a row or a column affects all the bits in that row or column
simultaneously. By ensuring that the most significant bits are set to 1 in as many rows as possible,
and then adjusting the remaining columns based on the majority values, we can maximize the score of
the matrix.

Dry - Run
Given Input:
grid =

        [0, 0, 1, 1]
        [1, 0, 1, 0]
        [1, 1, 0, 0]
Initialize variables:
n = 3(number of rows)

m = 4 (number of columns)

res = (1 << (m - 1)) * n = (1 << 3) * 3 = 8 * 3 = 24

     [1, 1, 0, 0]
     [1, 0, 1, 0]
     [1, 1, 0, 0]
since our 1st row's 1st element is 0 and we have to make all the elements in our 1st column as 1s to
maximize our score, we'll toggle our first row

Iterate through columns ( j = 1 to m - 1):

j = 1:

val = 1 << (m - 1 - j) =1 << 2 = 4
set = 2(since grid[0][1] == grid[0][0] and grid[2][1] == grid[2][0])
res += Math.max(set, n - set) * val
= Math.max(2, 1) * 4
= 2 * 4 =8
res = 24 + 8 = 32
no need to toogle this column
j = 2:

val = 1 << (m - 1 - j) = 1 << 1 = 2

set = 2 (since grid[1][2] == grid[1][0] and grid[2][2] == grid[2][0])

res += Math.max(set, n - set) * val
= Math.max(2, 1) * 2
= 2 * 2 = 4

res = 32 + 4 = 36

  [1 ,1 ,1 ,0]
  [1 ,0 ,0 ,0]
  [1 ,1 ,1 ,0]
j = 3:

val = 1 << (m - 1 - j) = 1 << 0 = 1

set = 0 (since grid[0][3] != grid[0][0], grid[1][3] != grid[1][0], and grid[2][3] != grid[2][0])

res += Math.max(set, n - set) * val
= Math.max(0, 3) * 1
= 3 * 1 = 3

res = 36 + 3 = 39

  [1 ,1 ,1 ,1]
  [1 ,0 ,1 ,1]
  [1 ,1 ,1 ,1]
Return the final result:

return res = 39
