/*
You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size n x n, where (r, c) represents:

A cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1
An empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0
You are initially positioned at cell (0, 0). In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid,
including cells containing thieves.

The safeness factor of a path on the grid is defined as the minimum manhattan distance from any cell in the
path to any thief in the grid.

Return the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).

An adjacent cell of cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c) and (r - 1, c) if it exists.

The Manhattan distance between two cells (a, b) and (x, y) is equal to |a - x| + |b - y|, where |val| denotes the
absolute value of val.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
All paths from (0, 0) to (n - 1, n - 1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1).

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0).
The distance between them is | 0 - 0 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 3) is cell (1, 2).
The distance between them is | 0 - 1 | + | 3 - 2 | = 2.
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (3, 0) is cell (3, 2).
The distance between them is | 3 - 3 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.


Constraints:

1 <= grid.length == n <= 400
grid[i].length == n
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
There is at least one thief in the grid.

Intuition by https://leetcode.com/SanketSawant18
Approach
Multi-source BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Priority Queue (Max-Heap) for Pathfinding

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(n^2 log n)

Explanation
Initialization:

Check if the start or end cell contains a thief. If so, return 0.
BFS for Distance Calculation:
Initialize a 2D array to store the minimum distance from each cell to the nearest thief.
Perform BFS starting from all thief cells, setting their distance to 0 and propagating distances
to adjacent cells.
Max-Heap for Finding Path with Maximum Safeness:
Use a max-heap to find the path with the maximum safeness factor.
Track visited cells to avoid revisiting.
Path Search:
Pop from the heap and check if the end cell is reached. If so, return the safeness factor.
For each neighbor, calculate the new safeness factor and push it into the heap if it hasn't been visited yet.
