/*
 * Time Complexity:
 * The time complexity of the sliding window technique is usually linear or close to linear, O(n),
 * where n is the size of the input data structure (e.g., array or string).
 * This is because you process each element once as the window slides through the data.
 * Space Complexity:
 * The space complexity of the sliding window technique is generally constant, O(1), because you’re
 * maintaining a fixed-size window and a few additional variables to perform calculations or store
 * intermediate results.
 * The amount of extra memory used does not grow with the input size; it remains constant regardless
 * of the input size.
 * Problems Solved by this technique:
 * Maximum/Minimum Subarray Sum:
 * Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters:
 * Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement:
 * Find All Anagrams in a String:
 * Smallest Subarray with Sum at Least K:
 * Maximum Consecutive Ones after Flipping Zeros:
 * Minimum Window Substring:
 * Longest Repeating Character Replacement:
 * Fruit Into Baskets:
 * Subarrays with Product Less than K:
 * Problem: Given an array of positive integers and an integer K, find the length of the
 * longest subarray whose sum is less than K.
 * Initialize variables: left to track the start of the subarray and right to iterate
 * through the array.
 * Initialize windowSum as the first element of the array.
 * Initialize maxLength to keep track of the maximum subarray length.
