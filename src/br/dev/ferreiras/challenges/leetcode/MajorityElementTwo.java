/**
 * Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,3]
 * Output: [3]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [1]
 * Output: [1]
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1,2]
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Approach
 * Initialization:
 * We initiate two candidate variables and their respective counters.
 * These candidates will represent potential elements that could appear more
 * than n/3 times
 * Voting Mechanism:
 * As we traverse through the array:
 * If we find a number equal to either of our candidates, we increment the respective counter.
 * If one of the counters is zero, we replace the respective candidate with the current number
 * and reset the counter.
 * If the current number doesn't match either candidate, both counters are decremented.
 * Verification: The two candidates selected might not actually be numbers that appear more than
 * n/3 times. So, we need to traverse the array again to count and verify their occurrences.
 * Why It Works?
 * The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm leverages the fact that any number that appears more than
 * k / n times will have at most k−1 such numbers.
 * By generalizing the algorithm to maintain two candidates and counters, we can handle
 * the k = 3 case for this problem. The decrementing of counters ensures that if a number
 * truly appears more than n /3 times it will survive till the end.
 * What We Have Learned?
 * This problem teaches us the power of algorithm generalization and thinking beyond
 * straightforward hash map solutions.
 * The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm's extension showcases the importance of understanding
 * underlying principles and insights of algorithms, enabling us to apply them in varied scenarios.
 * Complexity
 * Time complexity:
 * O(n)O(n)O(n). We go through the list thrice: once for voting and twice for counting.
 * Space complexity:
 * O(1)O(1)O(1). Only a constant amount of extra space is used, irrespective of the input size.
